Lino is a Discord bot that allows users to collect, trade, and manage K-pop cards within their servers. This Privacy Policy explains how Lino handles user data.

- Card inventory and folder data
- Bean balance (in-bot currency)
- Cooldowns and user game progress
- Optional profile settings (bio, display card, etc.)

We use the collected data only to:

- Track each userâ€™s card collection and in-game progress
- Manage economy features like tasks, gifting, and bean balances
- Display user profiles, leaderboards, and inventories
- All data is used strictly within the context of the game and is never sold, shared, or used for advertising.
